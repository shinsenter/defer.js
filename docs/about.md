## Getting started

Defer.js is an easy-to-use library that will help boost your website's performance by reducing loading times. Here's how to get started:

### Basic

Add the Defer.js library to your page by including a `<script>` tag just below the opening `<head>` tag.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>My Awesome Page</title>

  <!-- Add Defer.js here -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shinsenter/defer.js@3.6.0/dist/defer.min.js"></script>

  <!-- ... -->
</head>
```

### Inlining the library

To save an HTTP request, you can even inline the entire Defer.js library by copying its content from the [defer.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shinsenter/defer.js@3.6.0/dist/defer.min.js) and replacing the comments in the script tag with its content.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>My Awesome Page</title>

  <!-- Add the Inlined Defer.js here -->
  <script>/* Defer.js content goes here */</script>

  <!-- ... -->
</head>
```

### Compatibility with older versions

If you're using an older version of Defer.js, you can use `defer_plus.min.js` instead of `defer.min.js`.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>My Awesome Page</title>

  <!-- Put defer_plus.min.js here -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shinsenter/defer.js@3.6.0/dist/defer_plus.min.js"></script>

  <!-- ... -->
</head>
```

### For OLD browsers (such as IE9)

To enhance performance for legacy browsers that don't support the `IntersectionObserver` feature, you can load the IntersectionObserver polyfill library after the `defer.min.js` script tag.

```html
<script>/* Defer.js content */</script>

<!-- Add the IntersectionObserver Polyfill for legacy browsers -->
<script>'IntersectionObserver'in window||document.write('<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shinsenter/defer.js@3.6.0/dist/polyfill.min.js"><\/script>');</script>
```

*NOTE*: Modern browsers support the `IntersectionObserver` feature, so you don't have to worry about adding the polyfill if you don't have legacy browsers in mind.
